Juan M. Haut (Senior member, IEEE) is a professor with the Department of Computers and Communications at the University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain. Also, he is a member of the Hyperspectral Computing Laboratory (HyperComp) at the Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, where he received the B.Sc and M.Sc. degrees in computer engineering in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Information Technology in 2019 supported by an University Teacher Training Programme from the Spanish Ministry of Education. Dr. Haut was a recipient of the Outstanding Ph.D. Award at the University of Extremadura in 2019. His research interests include remote sensing data processing and high dimensional data analysis, applying machine (deep) learning and cloud computing approaches. In this sense, he has authored/co-authored more than 50 JCR journal articles (more than 30 in IEEE journals) and more than 30 peer-reviewed conference proceeding papers. Some of his contributions have been recognized as hot-topic publications for their impact on the scientific community.  Also, he was a recipient of the Outstanding Paper Award in the 2019 and 2021 IEEE WHISPERS conferences. From his experience as a reviewer, it is worth mentioning his active collaboration in more than 10 scientific journals, such as the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, and he has been awarded with the Best Reviewer recognition of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters and IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing in 2018 and 2020 respectively. Furthermore, he has guest-edited three special issues on hyperspectral remote sensing for different journals. He is also an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Gesocience and Remote Sensing Letters and IEEE Journal on Miniaturization for Air and Space Systems.
